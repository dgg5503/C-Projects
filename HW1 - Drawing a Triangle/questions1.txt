1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    /home/stu13/s10/dgg5503
    
2. What command will display the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    ls -F
    
3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    cd Courses
    
4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    mkdir csci243
    
5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -c warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems.
    
    a.) What compiler flag is used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        -Wall -Wextra -pedantic
    
    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c.
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        - Main requires either 0 (void) or 2 arguments (int argc, char *argv[]).
        - The variable b in the function compute is never used after computing a * 5.
        - x is defined and never used within the program
        - argc parameter in the main function is defined and never used within the program
        - The function compute is of type "int" but does not return anything!
    
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
   -std=c99
   
7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess
    D. Compile
    
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    C, D, B, A
