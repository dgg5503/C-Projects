Project 3 - Douglas Gliner / dgg5503@rit.edu
5/10/16

XTRA CREDIT:
I implemented the IPv4 checksum and PCAP file output as well.
To use IPv4 checksum, provide the optional param of '-c'.
To record blocked packet data to a PCAP file, supply the optional
parameter '-l <name of file>.pcap' to record packets.

Other Stuff:
Unless I did something HORRIBLY WRONG, I thought this was one of the
easier projects amongst the three given. Probably for the better since
it's towards the end of the semester. Regardless, I really loved this
class and I honestly think C is the best programming language ever!!
I hope I can take other CS classes where we use C or C++. Thanks for
the wonderful year and really fun projects :D!!
